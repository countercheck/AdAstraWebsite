							      	<h3>Squadron Strike</h3>
									<p>Any ship, any universe, fully 3-D! Squadron Strike features the most flexible ship construction system in any space combat game, allowing you to construct the ships from your favorite books, movies, and TV shows. (Or, let your imagination run wild.) Then you can fight them in 3-D! Building on the movement system from Saganami Island Tactical Simulator, 2nd edition, Squadron Strike adds ships that go "Whoosh!" with a system that allows cinematic, vector, and "UFO" movement all in the same game.</p>

									<h3>Birds of Prey</h3>
									<p>Birds of Prey is a revolutionary game of dogfighting in the jet age. Air combat is the ultimate three-dimensional environment and Birds of Prey captures that three-dimensionality like no game before. With a consistent flight model that works the same whether you’re turning in the horizontal or in the vertical (”looping”), Birds of Prey avoids the rafts of special rules that made other air combat games difficult to learn and prone to player error.</p>

							  	<h3>Volunteers</h3>
							  	<p>We pride ourselves on the enthusiasm and friendliness of the people who love our games.  We also shamelessly use it.  But not without reward!</p>
								<p>If you own one of our games and would like to demo it at a store or convention, please e-mail us at design@adastragames.com. Include your name, the name of the store, and the store's contact information (including e-mail address, if possible). Let us know that a demo is going to be run (posting it in the Conventions and Demos topic on the Forums will suffice).</p>
								<p>After a demo, have the store or convention organizer send us a quick e-mail to say when it happened, so we can put you in the Pathfinder program and get you accruing Hazard Pay.</p>
								<p>If you have to cancel a demo, please contact the store or convention organizer ahead of time so they can use the space for something else.</p>
								<h4>Perks</h4></br>
								<ul>
									<li>Pathfinders can redeem Hazard Pay for vouchers for Ad Astra Games products.</li>
									<li>Certain materials are available only to Pathfinders.</li>
									<li>When we commission fiction pieces for Nexus Journal and other products, we auction off the names and and traits of characters (or the names of ships) to Pathfinders, giving them a chance to shape the future of the Ten Worlds setting.</li>
									<li>What do we look for in a Pathfinder? First and foremost, a good relationship with the people who're hosting your demo. We do check back with stores and convention organizers to say, “Hey, according to our records, so and so was supposed to run a demo...how did it go?” This gets us information on what helps our products move.</li>
								</ul>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>How to Run a Successful Demo</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Let the store or convention organizer know about the demo ahead of time; feel free to print out any of the promotional flyers on the web site to garner interest.</li>
									<li>Be prompt.</li>
									<li>Be prepared. The first chapter of most of our rulebooks have a demo script built in to get people into the game with the minimum of fuss.</li>
									<li>Take along a friend (even a non-gaming friend!). It's much easier to lure in prey new players if you're already talking about the game to someone else.</li>
									<li>Put on your best “talk to strangers” face. Smile!</li>
									<li>Don't be afraid to teach the game to younger players. The golden age of gaming is 12 to 14 … and demo experience from previous Pathfinders shows that younger players learn our games more readily than adults!</li>
									<li>Never, ever denigrate someone else's game of choice! (Even if you feel one of ours is blatantly superior.) Offer to play their game if they'll play yours at the demo today—build cross-overs.</li>
									<li>Clean up the area after you're done demoing. Check in with your contact person at the store or convention.</li>

									<h3>Retailer Support</h3>
									<h4>Distributors</h4>
									<p>Ad Astra Games' product line is carried by:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Alliance Hobbies and Games</li>
										<li>ACD</li>
										<li>Blackhawk</li>
										<li>Esdevium</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>In-Store and Convention Demonstrations</h4>
									<p>To create an active player base, Ad Astra has created the Pathfinder program, a support program for stores and conventions who want someone to come out and demo the game. If you run a retail store or organize a convention we can send a Pathfinder to your site to demonstrate and teach a product. E-mail us at design@adastragames.com for more information, including what we require on your end.</p>
									<p>We firmly believe in supporting the retail arm of the adventure game industry. It's sales at game stores that bring new people into the adventure gaming hobby. In this day of Internet sales and “online discounters,” an active, store-supported gaming community is essential to the survive of all tiers of the industry.
									We also want people to actively play our games, rather than buy them, read them, admire them, and put them on the shelf wishing there was someone to play with. Active players create other active players, who buy more products at game stores, causing distributors to orders more products from us.</p>

									<h3>Educators</h3>
									<p>Ad Astra believes that games should engage the mind, and so educate as well as entertain. All of our games have educational uses in the classroom.

									</ul>

								  	<h3>Playtesting For Ad Astra Games</h3>
									<p>Playtesting is important to developing any kind of game or game engine, and triply so for any game company trying to set a series of games in the same universe.</p>
									<p>Ad Astra Games encourages playtesters to contact us; however, experience has shown that roughly 5% of playtest drafts actually get responses back. Most people get them, read them, say "Cool" and file them away on their hard drives without actually breaking out the parts needed to play. Every now and then, we get commentary from folks who read the rules thoroughly, which is handy -- but one "We played and found X" outweighs a thousand "I read and I thinks".  It's also a simple matter that Ad Astra Games is a business. We need to make money to pay for the time spent in developing the game, the resources spent in developing this web site, and paying for server and connectivity fees.</p>
									<p>To that aim, there are two conditions to becoming a playtester for Ad Astra Games.</p>
									<p>First, you must agree not to redistribute the game. This is, in essence, playing nice with our copyright and the trust we place in you in giving you pre-release material. If we send you a draft, we don't want to see it on Napster or Gnutella or on your web site. Now, printing out a copy of the game to play with your friends is allowed, as is sharing your copy with your friends so they can learn the game.</p>
									<p>Second, we need an honorarium. This can be as simple as a $10 (or greater) donation through PayPal per game line you're testing. So long as you keep sending reports in by the deadlines listed, you'll keep receiving pre-release drafts of that particular game without further payment.</p>
									<p>If you miss three deadlines in a row without a reason, we take you off of the list. To get back on, you need to make another honorarium.</p>
									<p>The honorarium need not be cash. If you have skills or technical expertise to trade, we'll cheerfully work out payment in service. Right now, Ad Astra could really use a solid CGI programmer for some functions on the web site, and we're open to suggestions in this regard.</p>
									<p>Ad Astra Games will also publish a list of currently active playtesters, their email addresses, and the version number of the draft they're working on, as well as their last report date, to make it easier for people to find an active playtest group to join.</p>
									<p>Accredited playtesters will receive one copy of the game they worked on upon publication.</p>
									<p>More material will be added to this page on a regular basis.</p>
